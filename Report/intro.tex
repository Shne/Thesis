\section{Introduction}
[Wavelet trees are interesting because...]

In this thesis we wish to implement various algorithms for constructing a wavelet tree, test and compare their running times and attempt a number of optimizations such as trying to minimize cache misses, branch mispredictions, and [SOMETHING SOMETHING Translation Lookaside Buffer].

We will implement the basic construction algorithm based on the description found in~\citep{ Navjda13}
