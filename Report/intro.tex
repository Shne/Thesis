\section{Introduction}
[Wavelet trees are interesting because...]

In this thesis we wish to implement various algorithms for constructing a wavelet tree, test and compare their running times and attempt a number of optimizations such as trying to minimize Cache Misses (CM), Branch Mispredictions (BM), and Translation Lookaside Buffer Misses (TLBM).

We will implement the basic construction algorithm based on the description found in~\citep{ Navjda13}. 
We will also implement a more advanced algorithm constructing a \textit{wavelet suffix tree}, which is different, yet analogous, to a wavelet tree, but with a better theoretical running time, as described in~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/BabenkoGKS14}. Finally, we will implement a parallelized version as described in~\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/Shun14}

Our focus will be to implement something useful in real world scenarios and we will use inputs we believe to be realistic use cases.
We will also avoid impractical optimizations such as ones that require recompilation to handle different sizes or alphabets.
