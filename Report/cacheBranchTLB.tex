\section{Cache, Branch prediction and Translation Lookaside Buffer}

\subsection{Cache design and cache misses}
A cache is a small fast memory storage that holds the most recently used memory.
Using caches can improve the memory access time many-fold, which is important since memory access is often a bottleneck in programs.
Modern CPUs have a prefetcher that attempts to predict future memory accesses and fetches them into the cache ahead of time.
Therefore, the pattern in which a program accesses the memory can have significant influence on the performance of the program.
Modern memory systems usually have three levels of caches: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3). \citep[Section~4.5.1]{Tanenbaum}.

\label{fig:CacheLevels}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:CacheLevels} \footnote{Figure borrowed from: \citep[Section~4.5.1]{Tanenbaum}} shows how the three cache are placed in the relation to the CPU. 
The L1 cache resides on the CPU chip itself and usually has a size in the range from 16 KB to 128 KB and because it is placed directly on the CPU chip it is able to provide very fast memory access.
The L2 cache is placed next to the CPU chip on the CPU package and it is connected to the CPU via a high speed path. The L2 cache typically has a size between 512 KB and 1 MB which means that it can hold more data but is not able to provide as fast access as L1.
The L3 cache is placed on the processor board and usually has a size around 3 MB. 
Since it is placed further away from the cpu it is not able to provide as fast access as L1 and L2 but still much faster than fetching data from RAM.

All three caches are inclusive which means that L2 contains the data from L1 and L3 contains the data from L2.
This means that if data is evicted from L1 it will still reside in the L2 and L3 caches or if data is evicted from L2 it will still reside in L3. 
This is an advantage because it allows fast access to data even if it is evicted from L1 or L2. 
If the caches were not inclusive then it would result in a many more data requests to the main memory.

There are two types of address locality that the caches exploit to improve performance: Spatial Locality and Temporal Locality.
Spatial Locality is that, when memory locations have addresses numerically close to a recently accessed memory location, they are more likely to be accessed soon.
Temporal Locality is that, when memory locations have been accessed recently, they are more likely to be accessed again soon.
The cache exploits spatial locality by fetching more data than has been requested, either by loading a larger chunk of memory than requested, such as a cache-line, or by speculatively fetching more cache-lines based on previously recognized access pattern.  This speculation is performed by the cache prefetcher and assumes that it is possible to anticipate future requests by looking at the previous access pattern.
Temporal locality is exploited by choosing what to evict on a cache miss and normally it is the data entries that has been accessed least recently that are evicted.

Data in the main memory is split into blocks of fixed size called \textit{cache-lines}. 
There are usually 4 to 64 consecutive bytes in a cache-line. 
Some of these cache-lines are always present in the caches. 
If a requested word is in the cache, a trip to main memory can be avoided, but if the word is not in the cache then a cache-line must be evicted from the cache (assuming that the cache is full, which it always is after the first few seconds of operation) and the cache-line containing the word must be fetched from main memory or a lower level cache if one is present. 
This is called a \textbf{cache miss} and has a high penalty because fetching a new cache-line is expensive.
The general idea is to have the most heavily used cache-lines in the caches as much of the time as possible to reduce the amount of cache misses.

\subsubsection{Cache associativity}
When designing a cache it is important to consider whether each cache-line can be stored in any cache slot or only in some of them.
There are three approaches to solving this problem; \textit{direct mapped cache}, \textit{n-way set-associative cache} and \textit{fully associative cache}. 

In a \textit{direct mapped cache} each cache-line can only be stored in a specific cache slot, the address of which is found by using a mapping function on address of the original main memory address, e.g.
\[cacheAddress = memoryAddress\bmod cacheslots\]
This means that two cache-lines cannot be mapped to the same slot simultaneously.
Given a memory address it is only necessary to look for it in one place in the cache and if it is not there then it is not in the cache. Using this approach, and an appropriate mapping function, consecutive memory lines are placed in consecutive cache slots. 
The problem with a \textit{direct mapped cache} is that since there are many more cache-lines in main memory than there are room for in the cache, many cache-lines ends up competing for the same slot. 
These competing cache-lines might end up constantly evicting each other which results in a substantial performance loss.

This problem can be fixed by using a \textit{n-way set-associative cache}, which is a cache that allows \textit{n} slots for each cache address.
This way if we have two cache-lines \textit{A} and \textit{B} whose addresses map to the same cache address and that address is already occupied by \textit{A} while \textit{B} tries to use the same address then \textit{A} does not have to be evicted because the cache has $n-1$ other slots to place \textit{B} in.
If all \textit{n} slots are occupied then a cache-line from one of them has to be evicted.
The question then becomes: Which one?

A popular algorithm, that determines which cache-lines to evict is called \textit{LRU (Least Recently Used)}.
It works by keeping an ordering of the slots at a cache address.
When a cache-line that is present in the cache is accessed the LRU algorithm updates the list by moving the entry corresponding to the accessed cache-line to the top of the list.
When an entry needs to be replaced it is the one at the end of the list that is evicted because it is the least recently used entry.

Alternatively, a \textit{fully associative cache} allows any cache-line to be saved in any cache slot but it is complicated and costly to implement in hardware because it for instance  might need to keep an ordered LRU list for the entire cache which would require a lot of bookkeeping.

The \textit{n-way set-associative cache} is the most popular choice because it has a good trade-off between implementation complexity and cache-hit rate.


\subsection{Branch Prediction and Misprediction}
Modern computers are highly pipelined and pipelining works best on non-branching code because the fetch unit is then able to read consecutive words from memory and also better make use of prefetching.
Typically, modern programs are full of branch instructions, however.

There are conditional branches and unconditional branches. 
An example of an unconditional branch and a conditional branch is shown in figure~\ref{fig:branchexample} \footnote{Example borrowed from: \citep[Section~4.5.2]{Tanenbaum}} where \textit{BNE Else} is a conditional branch and \textit{BR Next} is an unconditional branch.
 

\begin{figure}
\begin{algorithmic}
\If{$i = 0$}
	\State $k \gets 1$
\Else
	\State $k \gets 2$
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}

A possible translation to assembly looks like this:
\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{compactenum}
\item \itab{ } \tab{\texttt{CMP} $0,1$} \tab{: compare i to 0}
\item \itab{ } \tab{\texttt{BNE Else}} \tab{: branch to \texttt{Else} if not equal}
\item \itab{\texttt{Then:}} \tab{\texttt{MOV} $k,1$} \tab{: move 1 to k}
\item \itab{ } \tab{\texttt{BR Next}} \tab{: unconditional branch to \texttt{Next}}
\item \itab{\texttt{Else:}} \tab{\texttt{MOV} $k,2$} \tab{: move 2 to k}
\item \itab{\texttt{Next:}}
\end{compactenum}

\end{figure}

An unconditional branch is a simple jump to a specified label, it is not based on a condition and does not pose any significant problems.
A conditional branch jumps to one of two places in the code based on whether a given condition is true of false.
The ambiguity in a conditional branch is problematic because of the nature of modern pipelined CPU architectures where the stage of the pipeline that computes the result of a comparison is many stages later than the fetching unit.
Before the result of the comparison is computed, the fetcher does not know where in the program code to fetch from.


Old pipelined machines would just stall until it was decided what branch to take. 
Doing this has a heavy impact on performance if there is a lot of conditional branches in a program, which there usually are.
Modern machines try to predict what branch is most likely to be taken, using a branch prediction unit, and then executes that code until it is known whether the branch was predicted correctly or not. 
If the branch was predicted correctly then the execution simply continues.
If the branch was mispredicted then the executed instructions in the mispredicted branch needs to be rolled back and the correct branch must be taken. 
Undoing the effects of the wrong execution path is an expensive operation which means that it is important to minimize the amount of branch mispredictions as much as possible to get good performance.
