\section{Simple, Naïve Algorithm}
This is the simple, straightforward, naïve implementation we did before any smart ideas and optimizations.
\subsection{Algorithm Description}
The Naïve Wavelet Tree construction algorithm is recursively defined, calling itself to construct the left and right sub-tree from the root node and down. At each recursion the algorithm splits the given alphabet in two halves and traverses the given string putting each character into a left or right partition based on whether the character was in the left or right half of the alphabet.

\begin{mdframed}[nobreak]
\begin{algorithmic}
\Function {ConstructNode} {$String, Alphabet$}
\If{$Alphabet.Size() = 1$ or $String.Length() = 0$}
	\State \Return
\EndIf
\State Split $Alphabet$ into $LeftAlphabet$ and $RightAlphabet$
\State $Split \gets$ middle character in $Alphabet$
\ForAll {$Character$ in $String$}
	\If {$Character < Split$}
		\State $LeftString.Append(Character)$
		\State $Bitmap.Append(0)$
	\Else
		\State $RightString.Append(Character)$
		\State $Bitmap.Append(1)$
	\EndIf
\EndFor
\State $LeftNode \gets$ \Call {ConstructNode} {$LeftAlphabet, LeftString$}
\State $RightNode \gets$ \Call {ConstructNode} {$RightAlphabet, RightString$}
\EndFunction

\State \Call {ConstructNode} {InputString, InputAlphabet}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{mdframed}

\noindent In our implementation, $Alphabet$, $LeftAlphabet$, and $RightAlphabet$ are stored as two integer values each: a minimum and a maximum. It is explained in~\ref{sec:UsingIntAsChar} how this is equivalent to storing the full alphabet and passing pointers into it around. $Bitmap$ is stored as a \texttt{vector<bool>} which is tightly packed, only using 1 bit per bool\footnote{\url{http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector-bool/}}.



\subsection{Experiments}
[Running time, Cache-Misses, branch miss-predictions, etc]



[We then had the idea of skewing the tree to reduce branch mispredictions and cache-misses. but to reduce cache misses, we also need to control the memory layout... see following section]
