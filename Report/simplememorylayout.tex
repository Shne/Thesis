\section{Simple Algorithm with controlled Memory Layout}
Same algorithm as the Simple, Na√Øve approach, but with a controlled memory layout.

\subsection{Controlled Memory Layout}
In order to reduce cache misses from skewing the tree 
[What layout we wanted, why and how we did it]

\subsection{Preallocated}
[we tried preallocating, but found 

\subsection{Dynamic}

\subsection{Experiments}
[Testing Running time, cache-misses and branch mispredictions]
