\section{Simple Algorithm with controlled Memory Layout}
Same algorithm as the Simple, Na√Øve approach, but with a controlled memory layout.

\subsection{Controlled Memory Layout}
In order to reduce cache misses by skewing the tree, we needed a memory layout that would put the node that is most often accessed next, next in the memory, preferably in the same cache line. 
[What layout we wanted, why and how we did it]

\subsection{Preallocating the Memory}

\subsection{Experiments}
[Testing Running time, cache-misses and branch mispredictions]
\subsubsection{Preallocated}

\subsubsection{Dynamic}
