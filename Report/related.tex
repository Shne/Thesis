\section{Related Work}
The wavelet tree was first introduced in 2003 by Grossi, Gupta, and Vitter~\citeA[Section 4.2]{Grossi:2003:HET:644108.644250} as a way to obtain faster rank and select query times on compressed suffix arrays while maintaining empirical entropy compression.

Gonzalo Navarro~\citeA{Navarro:2014:WT:2592317.2592708} explains how the wavelet tree has many and wide ranging useful applications, from string processing including compression, full-text indexes and inverted indexes to geometry processing including various queries and computations on point grids and rectangle sets as well as graphs. 
In \citeA[Section 9]{Navarro:2014:WT:2592317.2592708} it is also mentioned that there are other data structures that achieves better time complexity than the wavelet tree, but the wavelet tree is more practical and easy to understand and implement.

Cristos Makris~\citeA{WTSurvey} also describes several effective uses for a wavelet tree, including viewing it as a range searching data structure for e.g. minimum bounding volumes and effective storage compression.
Using the wavelet tree as a compressing data structure is mainly about using various ways of encoding the bitmaps, such as using run-length encoding (RLE) on the bitmaps and storing the Burrows-Wheeler transformation (BWT) of the input string, or using Huffman Coding to shape the tree.
The Burrows-Wheeler transformation was introduced by Burrows and Wheeler~\citeA[Abstract]{BWToriginalArticle} in 1994.
Ferragina et al.~\citeA[Section~2]{waveletTreeEntropy} describes in more detail how BWT can be used to reduce the problem of compressing higher-order entropy to a problem of compressing 0-order entropy, which the wavelet tree then can do using RLE.
MÃ¤kinen and Navarro~\citeA[Section~4]{FMcountOnBWT} invented the Huffman-shaped wavelet tree and describes in short the general principle of it without going into much detail.

Another use of a wavelet tree is answering Range Quantile queries and is described by Gagie et al.~\citeA[Section 3]{RangeQuantileQueries}.



Claude and Navarro~\citeA[Section~2.2]{Claude08practicalrankselect} give a good description of how rank and select queries is performed on the wavelet tree in practice.
