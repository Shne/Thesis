In this thesis we perform a survey on the applications of wavelet trees.
We also implement various versions of wavelet trees, each version an attempt at improving the previous.
For each version we test and compare the running times and other measurements, analysing the results using the latter measurements to explain the differences in the running time, as well as inspire the next attempt at optimization.
