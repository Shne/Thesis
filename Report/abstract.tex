\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we perform a survey on the applications of wavelet trees.
We describe how and why modern cpu architectures give rise to certain hardware-based performance penalties.
We implement a wavelet tree and measure and analyse the performance and encountered hardware-based performance penalties of building and querying the tree.
Inspired by this analysis, we iteratively implement, measure, and analyse variations of the wavelet tree and its queries attempting to reduce the encountered penalties, running time and memory footprint.
